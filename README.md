# Scalable Self-Service AWS Finance Analytics Platform - Proof-of-Concept

This project demonstrates a proof-of-concept for an end-to-end Business Intelligence (BI) solution leveraging AWS services.

## Overview

The platform is designed to:
- Ingest financial data from an S3 data lake.
- Perform ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations using AWS Glue.
- Model data into a star schema within Amazon Redshift.
- Enable self-service data exploration and visualization (conceptually, via tools like Tableau).
- Support automated data refresh capabilities and alerting mechanisms (e.g., using AWS Lambda and SNS).

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains sample raw data and potentially processed data.
  - `data/raw/`: Sample raw input data files.
  - `data/processed/`: Data after ETL, ready for loading into the data warehouse.
- `etl/`: Contains AWS Glue ETL scripts (e.g., PySpark scripts).
- `sql/`: Contains SQL scripts for defining the Redshift schema (DDL), and potentially sample DML or queries.
- `infra/`: Contains notes or scripts for infrastructure setup (e.g., CloudFormation templates, Terraform scripts - conceptual).
- `docs/`: Additional documentation, design notes.

## Simulated Data

The project will use simulated financial data, including aspects like:
- Cost structures
- Capital expenditures (CapEx)
- Variance analysis (actual vs. budget)

## Technology Stack (Conceptual)

- **Data Lake:** Amazon S3
- **ETL:** AWS Glue
- **Data Warehouse:** Amazon Redshift
- **Orchestration & Automation:** AWS Lambda, Amazon CloudWatch Events (EventBridge)
- **Alerting:** Amazon SNS
- **Visualization:** Tableau (or similar BI tools - this project focuses on the backend data pipeline)

## Getting Started
